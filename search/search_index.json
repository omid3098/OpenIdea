But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. - Charles F. Brannan</p> WhyHowWhat <p>Like many others, I have ideas that I believe deserve to exist in the world. Often, I lack the time, resources, or expertise to turn them into reality, but someone else might not. This space is for sharing those ideas openly, increasing the chances they'll come to life through collaboration.</p> <p>For a while, I held onto them hoping to implement and benefit from them myself. But if an idea can truly improve the world, it shouldn't matter who builds it or who gets the credit. I might bring your idea to fruition; you might do the same for mine. Let's prioritize impact over ownership.</p> <ol> <li>Find: Browse existing ideas or identify a gap.</li> <li>Add: Copy <code>TEMPLATE.md</code>, fill in what's clear, and submit.</li> <li>Improve: Add comments or PRs with risks, prior art, or refinements.</li> <li>Adopt: If you're building it, update the status (Exploring / Building) to signal others.</li> <li>Ship: Link the repo or result, plus 1\u20132 key learnings. Ideas can always evolve.</li> </ol> <p>Principles: simple words, open credit, low ceremony, impact first.</p> <p>An open, minimal catalog of positive-impact product, tool, or service ideas.
