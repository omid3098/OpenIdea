```
If I give you an apple and you give me an apple, we both have an apple.
If I give you an idea and you give me an idea, we both have two ideas.
```

## Why

Like many others, I have ideas that I believe deserve to exist in the world. Often, I lack the time, resources, or expertise to turn them into reality, but someone else might not. This space is for sharing those ideas openly, increasing the chances they'll come to life through collaboration.

For a while, I held onto them hoping to implement and benefit from them myself. But if an idea can truly improve the world, it shouldn't matter who builds it or who gets the credit. I might bring your idea to fruition; you might do the same for mine. Let's prioritize impact over ownership.

## How

Flow (keep it light):

1. Find: Browse existing ideas or identify a gap.
2. Add: Copy `TEMPLATE.md`, fill in what's clear, and submit.
3. Improve: Add comments or PRs with risks, prior art, or refinements.
4. Adopt: If you're building it, update the status (Exploring / Building) to signal others.
5. Ship: Link the repo or result, plus 1–2 key learnings. Ideas can always evolve.

Principles: simple words, open credit, low ceremony, impact first.

## What

An open, minimal catalog of positive-impact product, tool, or service ideas. Each idea is designed to quickly convey:

- Problem (why it matters)
- Core insight / proposed approach
- Potential impact
- Existing alternatives / gap
- Status (Seed, Exploring, Building, Shipped)

Purpose: Minimize barriers between idea originators and builders, so valuable concepts become reality faster—and anyone can contribute.
